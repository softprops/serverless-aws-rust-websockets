# serverless aws websockets

exploration into Rust and [serverless websockets](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/websocket/)


## deploy

```sh
$ npm ci && npx serverless deploy
```

You can use the `wscat` command line utility to connect and communicate with your
serverless application.

```sh
$ npx wscat -c wss://{YOUR-API-ID}.execute-api.{YOUR-REGION}.amazonaws.com/dev
```

This should open up an interactive repl with which you can communicate with the server

You can send messages to the server with a json payload containing an "action" field of "send" with an optional text "message" field

```
connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
> {"action":"send"}
< {"message":"🏓 pong"}
> {"action":"send", "message":"psst"}
< {"message":"psst"}
```

## how it works

### Traditional websocket servers

A typical websocket server requires an ability to speak a binary protocol over an upgraded
http protocol connection. By its nature, that requires the operational capability to maintain a
long lived persistant connection with many connected clients.

A server with a sturdy security posture should
also provide a means of encrypting information passed across network connections. Secure websocket connections require additional handshake procedures which requires additional binary protocol extensions that you are responsible for.

### Serverless websocket applications

API Gateway replaces the need for you to write and operator traditional websocket servers. API Gateway exposing a tls (wss) websocket endpoint and manages persistent connections **for you** freeing you up to focus application specific details.

Your application need only implement functions to be invoked to specific lifecycle events called "routes". A few special routes are `$connect` `$disconnect` and `$default` which represent a new client connecting, an existing client disconnecting, and an unmapped request route respectively. You are not responsible for maintaining a network connections but you _are_ responsible
for maintaining **connection identifiers**. Managed serverless data stores like [Dynamo DB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) make storing this trivially simple.

You can also route based on a request pattern. By default, with Serverless framework, it's expected connected clients send the server JSON payloads containing an "action" field which a handler gets routed to based on its value. This example application routes on an action called "send".
